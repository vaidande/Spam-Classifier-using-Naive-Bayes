#Code to detect spam e-mails using Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a supervised classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. That is, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

It is a popular technique for text categorization, judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as features.

    We have a bunch of emails classified as 'spam' and a bunch of emails classified as 'ham' (not spam)
    The emails are first read and stored in a dataframe. They are then parsed using CountVectorizer
    This information is used to train the model and its prediction is then tested with a sample input

Python Libraries used: pandas, numpy, io, os, CountVectorizer and MultinomialNB from sklearn

The Spam classifier classifies the given input as a spam/ham. A sample output is found here.
Some Practical Applications:
